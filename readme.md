Organ Crush Saga - An entire game about one spleen...


A match is three or more organs in a column or row.
Start by moving any organs around. They don't have to create a match.
After a few turns, the stomach will appear and then the spleen.
Once both appear, you will have a limited number of turns to move the spleen adjacent to the stomach.
The stomach cannoted by move directly.
The spleen can only move if it makes a match.
Good luck!
